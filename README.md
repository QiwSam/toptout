# Toptout: easily opt-out from telemetry collection

Telemetry in software projects is a polarized issue: on the one hand it allows developers to improve their work by collecting various metrics, on the other hand - nobody likes to be spied on.
The goal of this project is to put you in control. See what data is collected by the tools you use and decide if you want to share it. Then use methods provided here to opt-in or opt-out.

## Details

The core of this project is a set of JSON files which describe what telemetry is collected and what can be done to enable or disable it. The README you see is automatically generated from those files.

## Contributing

If the tool you're using is not here you can easily add it by creating a new JSON file describing its telemetry data channels.

See [CONTRIBUTING](/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [data/README](data/README.md) for details.

## Future plans

- API to serve this data online.
- Automated tool that can ingest the data from the API. You could run it on your machine to detect and configure telemetry in all suported products.
